# No simple link between temporal discounting and body composition

This repository holds data and analysis code:

- `data/` contains raw data as well as processed and scored final data. Python code is used (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) so you can see exactly what was done.
- `analysis/` contains the `.jasp` files for Study 1 and Study 2.
- `meta_analysis/` contains the data and `.jasp` files for the pooled-data analysis.
- `veillard_vincent_2020_reanalysis/` contains data and `.jasp` files for the reanalysis of results by Veillard & Vincent (2020).
- `parameter recovery/` contains material for establishing the sensitive ranges of the discounting measures.
